Read this react project and the console application in C# at `prototype/ConsoleAppProto/ArrangeV4.ConsoleApp/`.

Update the react project to fetch all the calendars like what the console application does and display them in a list on the main page.
Make sure to handle authentication and permissions as needed.

The console application uses MSAL for authentication and Microsoft Graph API to fetch the calendars. You may need to set up similar authentication in the React project using MSAL.js or a similar library.

Refer to the Microsoft Graph API documentation for fetching calendars: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list-calendars?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http

Ensure that the React project is properly configured to use TypeScript and any necessary dependencies are installed.
